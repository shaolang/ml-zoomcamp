# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Capstone Project
This project tackles the classification of facial expressions. The
dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle FER12][data-source]. The main task
is to classify the facial expression for any given 48x48 grayscale image.

This project contains the following artifacts:

* `/train`: contains the images for training
* `/test`: contains the images for testing
* `requirements.txt`: states the Python packages necessary for running
  this project.
* `notebook.ipynb`: contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature
  transformation, multiple model training, model selection, and model
  hyperparameter-tuning.

# Running the Project

To run the project:

* Download and install [Python][python] version 3.8 and above.
* Download the artifacts from this repository.
* Navigate to the directory that contains the artifacts downloaded and
  run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python
  packages.
* Run `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter Notebook web server.
* Open `notebook.ipynb` shown in the web browser.
